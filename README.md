# Data-Processing
This repository contains `R` code used in the data processing of the twinsUK cohort.

We process data to obtain the following variables:
- `first_response`: First valid response at 50 or older. This will give the age at entry to study
- `first_fracture`: End of study or age at first fracture after inclusion to study whichever is earlier
- `Status`: Event indicator 1/0.
